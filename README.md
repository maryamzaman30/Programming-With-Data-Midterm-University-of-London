For my midterm project in Semester 4, I analyzed a heart failure prediction dataset. I conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the data, visualizing key features and identifying missing values or outliers. I performed feature engineering, created new features like age groups and BMI, and split variables into continuous and categorical types. The dataset was divided into training and testing subsets, and I built predictive models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests, evaluating them with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. I identified significant features for heart failure prediction and explored the impact of clinical parameters like ejection fraction and serum creatinine on patient outcomes. Finally, I summarized my findings and provided actionable insights and recommendations for healthcare providers.
